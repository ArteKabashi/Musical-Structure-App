# Musical-Structure-App

Musical Structure App for Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program

## The required components for this project are:

• 2 to 6 Activities that are linked via explicit intents <br>
• A custom class storing information about each song. Each instance of the custom class must contain at least 2 states <br>
 &nbsp; (e.g. Song Name,Artist Name). Images (e.g. Album Art) are not required but allowed. <br>
•A data structure, such as an ArrayList that would store Instances of the custom class. These instances should be retrieved and displayed in a ListView or GridView via an Adapter.<br>
